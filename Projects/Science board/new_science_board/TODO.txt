Chat with Florence, 22/11
General comments:
Testpoints on ALL THE THINGS (CAN, I2C, sensors)
LEDs on power rails
Possibly LEDs on sensors
We do not have centralised power rails so I need a 5V to 3V3 LDO of some sort (template apparently incoming)

Connector comments:

Still unsure about what encoders are being used
They do use 5V power 


Consider some extra I2C connectors just in case

Check pin table by Florence
2 limit switches for elevator

update connector sheet to match new net names
