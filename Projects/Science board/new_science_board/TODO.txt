General comments:
Testpoints on ALL THE THINGS (CAN, I2C, sensors)
LEDs on power rails
Possibly LEDs on sensors
We do not have centralised power rails so I need a 5V to 3V3 LDO of some sort (template apparently incoming)

Connector comments:
Separate ENC/LS from PWM/DIR (see previous design for reference)
Still unsure about what encoders are being used
They do use 5V power 
Limit switches get pulled up to 3V3
PWM gets pulled down
I forgot to pull up I2C

Consider some extra I2C connectors just in case
