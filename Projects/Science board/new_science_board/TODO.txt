General comments:

LEDs on power rails
Possibly LEDs on sensors
We do not have centralised power rails so I need a 5V to 3V3 LDO of some sort (template apparently incoming)

Connector comments:

Still unsure about what encoders are being used
They do use 5V power 


Consider some extra I2C connectors just in case
